import Component from "../../experiments/text-painting.svelte"

Here is a little experiment that allows you to paint with different text on a canvas. Changing the height and width will only take effect if you clear the canvas.
This effect is created using the [svelte](https://svelte.dev) framework and span tags for each character.
